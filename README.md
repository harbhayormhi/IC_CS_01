# 🔎 Web Vulnerability Scanner/web Automation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based web application security scanner developed during my cybersecurity internship with interncred.

The scanner automatically analyzes websites to detect common web vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations and check for SQL and XSS injection.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn automated vulnerability scanning
- Understand web security concepts
- Practice Python scripting for cybersecurity
- Implement OWASP Top 10 concepts

---

## 🚀 Features

- Website scrapper (link discovery)
- SQL Injection testing
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) testing
- Security header analysis
- Automated reporting

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs a target URL.
2. The scrapper collects internal website links.
3. Each page is scanned for:
   - SQL Injection vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Missing security headers
4. Results are compiled into a scan report.
